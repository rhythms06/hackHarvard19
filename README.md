**BandIt** is a social networking platform where artists form bands and jam.
It was built by Sakib Rasul and Satyam Singh for [HackHarvard19](https://hackharvard2019.devpost.com).
The application is divided into three major segments:
- Find an Artist, where artists can meet and form bands,
- Jam Session, where artists meet up at a fixed venue and time to jam together, and
- VR Jamming, where potential bandmates can meet virtually and share in a jam session of global proportions!

## Why we built it

Finding someone who shares your taste in music is difficult. For the lonesome musician, that's just the top of the iceberg:
not only do they want someone who likes the same music, but someone who can wield a certain subset of instruments,
enjoys playing certain genres, and potentially fits a whole host of other preferences.
The same way Tinder and Bumble work to pair those with the highest overlap in preferences in the realms of dating, business, and friends,
BandIt helps musicians find their next ideal jam partner. We hope that this experience enhances the ability of music to connect and inspire
people around the world.

## How we built it

We arrived at the hackathon knowing we wanted to build something around music. It's something we're all fond of.
After discussing our strengths (e.g. design, JS, Google Cloud) and experiences (e.g. working at Bumble),
we decided that a dating-style app thar pairs musicians would be the best use of our efforts.

Some notes from the team:

*Satyam*: "After it was decided that our domain was related to music I tried to figure out what purpose the application should fulfill.
After this, I decided the different pages our UI would have and the colour scheme, the visual hierarchy and fonts and the overall theme.
I went through quite a few modern fonts and different styles and finally designed an authentic UI."

*Sakib*: "I worked extensively on the frontend and backend of this app, utilizing Git for version control, React Native for the frontend,
Google Firebase/Firestore for the backend, and Expo for deployment and rapid testing."

## Challenges we ran into

*Satyam*: "There were issues like the features to be included in the application and its implementation while coding.
Deciding different landing pages for the application the fonts in order to stick to the theme of music.
I tried to maintain the authenticity as much as possible and that was the toughest part."

*Sakib*: "Collaborating over Git took some getting used to, as well as did connecting our app to Google Cloud products."

## Accomplishments we're proud of

*Satyam*: "It is my second UI project and I'm really proud how visually appealing it looks and how I could implement the important concepts of design
like the visual hierarchy and the contrasts."

*Sakib*: "This was my first time using React, and I'm proud of how far my skills in the framework have come over the weekend.
I'm also proud of how strongly our group bonded over the past few days!"

## What we learned

*Satyam*: "I learned to work under pressure and how to divide work in a team in order to get the work done quickly and efficiently.
I also learned some problem-solving skills and coding."

*Sakib*: "I learned about the usefulness of React, as well as the similarities between Firebase Storage and Firestore.
The latter helped me be less anxious about trying new things in CS."

## What's next

We would love to try implementing the VR Jamming experience in the future.
